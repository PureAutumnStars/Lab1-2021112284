A long time ago, my travels took me out of a quaint village. 
I did not know what to expect there. 
A cricket can not know too much, you know that, 
As I stood there warming my...myself, 
I took me look at this place. 
Well, you never saw such this place ------ 
the most quaint clocks as much I know that, 
and took me out of imagination much go that much go that unreachable.
